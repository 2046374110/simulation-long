Numerical experimental results of reconstructing the three-dimensional target "dragon" using the SFS-ORAP-PC-3D method. (a) Target 3D intensity map. (b) Target 3D depth map. (c) FS-ORAP. (d) Phase hologram. (e) Strength map of three-dimensional target after layering (8 layers). (f) SFS-ORAP-PC-3D method reconstruction results (8 layers).
As depicted in Figure, the SFS-ORAP-PC-3D method demonstrates the capability to generate a hologram of a 3D object using a single FS-ORAP. It enables the reconstruction of a realistic 3D scene with comprehensive depth cues and achieves dense layer reconstruction with precise depth accuracy and a large depth range.
